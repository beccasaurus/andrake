Andrake
=======

Andrake is a tool and a set of tools/libraries for making Android development easier and more enjoyable

The goal is to write every part of an Android app, except for the Java classes, in Ruby, making configuration *much* less painful.

Andrake should also work just as well for Eclipse development as for development from the command line.

Ideally, when you 'run' the appliction from Eclipse, it will 'compile' the correct files before executing.

Just wait until there are some examples!  You'll see  :)
