andrake
=======

this should be our DSL for building android apps ... a full dir structure of its own, potentially, 
although i VERY MUCH want to support the ability to easy create single file android apps (andrake apps)

an andrake app isn't an android app

an andrake app can be COMPILED to / converted into an android app (which it will be, in the background)
